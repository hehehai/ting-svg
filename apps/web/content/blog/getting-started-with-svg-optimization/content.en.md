# Getting Started with SVG Optimization

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files are powerful assets for modern web development, but they often contain unnecessary data that can slow down your website. In this guide, we'll explore how to optimize SVG files effectively.

## Why Optimize SVG Files?

SVG files exported from design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator often contain:

- Hidden metadata and comments
- Unused definitions and groups
- Redundant attributes
- Inefficient path data
- Default values that can be omitted

By optimizing these files, you can:

1. **Reduce file size** by 30-70%
2. **Improve page load times**
3. **Enhance rendering performance**
4. **Make your SVG code more maintainable**

## Basic Optimization Techniques

### Remove Unnecessary Metadata

Most design tools add metadata that browsers don't need:

```xml
<!-- Before -->
<svg xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
     xmlns:sketch="http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/ns">
  <!-- content -->
</svg>

<!-- After -->
<svg>
  <!-- content -->
</svg>
```

### Simplify Paths

Path data can often be simplified without visual changes:

```xml
<!-- Before -->
<path d="M10.000,10.000 L20.000,20.000" />

<!-- After -->
<path d="M10 10L20 20" />
```

### Remove Default Values

Many attributes have default values that don't need to be specified:

```xml
<!-- Before -->
<rect fill="black" stroke="none" />

<!-- After -->
<rect />
```

## Using Tiny SVG

Our tool makes optimization effortless:

1. **Upload or paste** your SVG file
2. **Preview** the before and after
3. **Download** the optimized version

All processing happens in your browser - your files never leave your device!

## Conclusion

SVG optimization is an essential step in modern web development. With the right tools, you can significantly reduce file sizes while maintaining perfect visual quality.
