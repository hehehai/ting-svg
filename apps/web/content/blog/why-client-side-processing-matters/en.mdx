# Why Client-Side Processing Matters for Privacy

In an age where data privacy is paramount, the way we process files online matters more than ever. Let's explore why client-side processing is the future of web applications.

## The Traditional Approach

Most online tools follow this pattern:

1. User uploads file to server
2. Server processes the file
3. Server sends back the result
4. Server may store your files

**Problem**: Your files leave your device and exist on someone else's computer.

## The Client-Side Approach

With client-side processing:

1. File stays in your browser
2. Processing happens locally
3. No network transfer needed
4. No server storage

**Benefit**: Your files never leave your device.

## Why This Matters

### 1. Complete Privacy

Your SVG files might contain:
- Proprietary designs
- Unreleased products
- Client work under NDA
- Sensitive information

With client-side processing, these files remain 100% private.

### 2. Better Security

No upload means:
- No man-in-the-middle attacks during transfer
- No server breaches exposing your files
- No accidental data leaks
- No terms of service concerns

### 3. Faster Processing

Client-side processing is often faster because:
- No upload/download time
- No server queue
- No network latency
- Direct processing on your hardware

### 4. Works Offline

Once the app loads, you can:
- Process files without internet
- Work on planes or trains
- Avoid connection issues
- Maintain productivity anywhere

### 5. Unlimited Usage

Server-based tools often limit:
- Number of files
- File sizes
- Processing frequency
- Features behind paywalls

Client-side tools have no such limits.

## How Tiny SVG Implements This

Our approach:

```javascript
// Everything happens in your browser
const worker = new Worker('svgo.worker.js');

worker.postMessage({ svg: yourSVGContent });

worker.onmessage = (e) => {
  const optimizedSVG = e.data;
  // Never leaves your browser!
};
```

### Web Workers for Performance

We use Web Workers to:
- Keep the UI responsive
- Process large files efficiently
- Run optimization in background threads
- Avoid blocking user interactions

### Local Storage Only

Your preferences are stored using:
- Browser's localStorage
- No cookies
- No tracking
- No external databases

## The Future of Web Apps

Modern browsers are incredibly powerful. They can:
- Process images and video
- Run complex calculations
- Handle large datasets
- Perform AI/ML inference

Client-side processing leverages this power while respecting your privacy.

## Trade-offs

Client-side processing isn't always perfect:

**Limitations**:
- Requires modern browser
- Uses device resources
- Limited by browser capabilities
- No cross-device sync (without explicit setup)

**When Server-Side Makes Sense**:
- Collaborative features needed
- Processing too intensive for browsers
- Cross-device synchronization required
- Centralized data management necessary

## Conclusion

For tools like SVG optimization, client-side processing offers the perfect balance of:
- Privacy
- Security
- Performance
- Convenience

Your files are yours. They should stay on your device.
