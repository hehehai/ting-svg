# SVG vs PNG: When to Use Each Format

Choosing between SVG and PNG can significantly impact your website's performance and visual quality. Let's explore when to use each format.

## What is SVG?

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a vector image format based on XML. It uses mathematical formulas to define shapes, paths, and colors.

### Advantages of SVG

- **Infinitely scalable** - looks perfect at any size
- **Small file size** - especially for simple graphics
- **Editable** - can be modified with code
- **SEO-friendly** - searchable and indexable
- **Accessible** - can include text alternatives

### Best Use Cases for SVG

- Logos and icons
- Illustrations and diagrams
- UI elements
- Charts and graphs
- Simple animations

## What is PNG?

PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a raster image format that stores images as a grid of pixels.

### Advantages of PNG

- **Supports transparency** - alpha channel
- **Wide compatibility** - works everywhere
- **Better for complex images** - photographs, gradients
- **Lossless compression** - no quality loss

### Best Use Cases for PNG

- Photographs
- Complex graphics with many colors
- Screenshots
- Images with text that needs to be crisp
- When you need transparency with photos

## Performance Comparison

| Feature | SVG | PNG |
|---------|-----|-----|
| File Size (simple logo) | 2-5 KB | 10-50 KB |
| Scalability | Perfect at any size | Pixelated when scaled |
| Colors | Limited for simple graphics | Millions of colors |
| Animation | CSS/JS animations | Requires GIF or video |
| Editing | Easy with code | Requires image editor |

## Making the Right Choice

Choose **SVG** when:
- The graphic is relatively simple
- You need it to scale perfectly
- You want to animate or interact with it
- File size matters

Choose **PNG** when:
- The image is a photograph
- The graphic has complex gradients or effects
- You need pixel-perfect rendering
- SVG support is a concern

## Hybrid Approach

Modern websites often use both:

- SVG for UI elements, logos, and icons
- PNG for photos and complex graphics
- WebP as a fallback for better compression

## Conclusion

Both formats have their place in web development. Understanding their strengths helps you make informed decisions that improve both performance and visual quality.
